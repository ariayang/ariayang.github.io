My dream to become a software engineer started before college. Somehow, I became a hardware development engineer with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. Switching career path is never easy but it's never too late to try. 

Since late last year in 2020, I started to pick-up Python again and finished a few introductary courses on Coursera. Early this year, I started the famous "Data Structure" class in Berkeley (CS61B). That surely was a tough one. I first followed Prof. Jonathan ShewchukThat's 2006 videos. I still remembered the multiple sleepless nights struggling to debug my 1st Java project: "Sharks and Fish in ocean". The rest is history.

Now I am setting my goal to be a front end engineer. And I want to share my learnings here. This is a road many have travelled, but presents unique challenges to every individual. But I believe the process of learning and overcoming obstacles is part of the most exciting life aspects. I strive to be better each day.
